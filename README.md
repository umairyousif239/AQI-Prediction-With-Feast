**API Key:**
For the API key, I went with OpenWeatherMap API as it's one of the most versatile weather APIs. Another reason for choosing OpenWeatherMap API was because of its free access for students. This allowed me to experiment with the api a lot more and test out various features without incurring any cost.

**Fetching Data:**
after setting up the API, i made the program fetch pollution data and weather data separately from two different APIs. this allowed me to add in more features to use for when i train the model. i made the program get rid of unnecessary components fetched from the api calls and only kept the necessary components in a csv file. an issue that i encountered while fetching the data from the API was that i could only fetch data of 8 days in a single request. so the way i tackled that issue was to have the program request the data in batches of 5 days in each request. this allowed me to fetch the data of previous 90 days as i had wanted to.
